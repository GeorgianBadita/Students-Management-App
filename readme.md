# Students Management Application 

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I've created an application which can manage students by keeping track of their activity, assigning and grading their homework.</p>
<p>The main features of the application consist of:</p>

   * Creating various types of accounts (ADMININSTRATOR, STUDENT, PROFESSOR) - each account type having its own rights
   * Grading students and creating assignments for them
   * Filtering students/homework/grades by different criterias
   * Generating reports
   * Possibility to notify students when they receive a grade via email
<h2> Technologies used </h2>

<p>For creating this application I've used Java, Javafx and JavaMailApi to send emails via Gmail.
